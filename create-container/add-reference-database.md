# Add a Reference Database

To classify genomes taxonomically you need to install a referene database. There are two currently available, **TypeMat_Lite** and **Phyla_lite**. As of December 2020, *TypeMat_Lite** contains 13,508  genomes from type material. **Phyla_lite** contains one reference genome from each of the 40 bacterial and archael phyla.  

**Note:** If you are running MiGA on a cluster, see the section **Installing MiGA using Singularity** for instructions on installing the reference databases. This is because installing larger databases on a cluster should be done by submititng a job.
