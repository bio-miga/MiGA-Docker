# Add a Reference Database

To classify genomes taxonomically you need to install a referene database. There are two currently available, **TypeMat_Lite** and **Phyla_lite**. As of December 2020, *TypeMat_Lite** contains 13,508  genomes from type material. **Phyla_lite** contains one reference genome from each of the 40 bacterial and archael phyla.  

**Note:** If you are running MiGA on a cluster, see the section **Installing MiGA using Singularity** for instructions on installing the reference databases. This is because installing larger databases on a cluster should be done by submititng a job.  

## Installing Reference Databases (Optional)

If you want to classify submitted genomes taxonomically, there are presently two reference databases available for the purpose. If you attach one of these to a project, then every reference genome submitted to the project will be classified.

The two reference databases available are **TypeMat_Lite** and **Phyla_Lite**. The December 2020 version of **TypeMat_Lite** contains over 13,500 reference genomes from type material, and **Phyla Lite** contains one reference genome from each of 40 bacterial and archaeal phyla. 

For a local installation of MiGA, the databases may be installed using either the command line or the browser interface.
