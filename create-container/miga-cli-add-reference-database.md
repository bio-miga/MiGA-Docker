# Add Reference Databases from the Command Line

Being so much smaller, **Phyla_Lite** takes only a few minutes to install. With **MiGA** running, the following command will install it in `~/.miga_db`:  

```
miga get_db -n Phyla_Lite
```

**TypeMat_Lite** takes at least an hour to install, even with a fast internet connection.  Install it in the same directory with the following comamnd:  

```
miga get_db -n TypeMat_Lite
```
