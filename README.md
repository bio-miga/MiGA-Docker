# MiGA Containers

MiGA - the Microbial Genome Atlas - for everyone!  
Now there is a docker image for MiGA so that both the command line version and MiGA-Web version can be run under Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The same image can also be installed in a user's home directory on a high performance cluster using Singularity. Plus, for those with larger MiGA jobs to run and no access to high a performance cluster, there is now a MiGA Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Amazon Web Services (AMS). In all cases except for Singularity, MiGA may be run with both commmand line and web-based interfaces.

This document provides instructions for installing all of these versions of MiGA and includes tutorials for installing reference databases and running MiGA jobs on all platforms.
