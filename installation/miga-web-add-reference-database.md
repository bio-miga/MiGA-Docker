# Add a Reference Database

Any collection of reference genomes can serve as a reference database against which to compare query sequences. If you are working on a small group, say genomes from the same genus, then assembling your own reference database of already sequenced genomes from the genus may suffice for your purposes. This approach will not give you the phylogeny of the query sequence, but will inform you as to which of the reference genomes in the project are closest to your query sequence, and by what percent **AAI** (average amino acid identity) or **ANI** (average nucleotide identity).

If you want to actually classify a genome taxonomically, there are two reference databases available for the purpose. If you attach one of these to a project, then every reference genome submitted to the project will be classified taxonomically. 

The two reference databases available are **TypeMat Lite** and **Phyla Lite**. TypeMat Lite contains 13,265 reference genomes from type material, and Phyla Lite contains reference genomes from all bacterial and archaeal phyla. 

To install one or both of the reference datbases, go to the **Admin console** page, click on **Download databases**, and choose one of the blue buttons to start the download. These are large files, so you will need a fast internet connection or plenty of time.

For an example of how to use one of these reference databases see the section **Running Projects**, **Classify a Genome**, **Using a Reference Database**.
