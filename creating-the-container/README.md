# Creating the MiGA Container

The same MiGA Docker image may be installed locally or on a high-performance cluster, but the procedures differ. For a local installation, the image is installed using conventional Docker commands, and the program may be accessed via either the command line interface or using a browser. To install it on a cluster, the Docker image is installed using Singularity and access is via the command line.
