# Add Reference Databases using MiGA-Web

Unless you are using the Singulairty version of **MIGA** on a cluster, the preferred way of downloading the reference datahases is to use the MiGA-Web interface. First start **MiGA-Web**, create an account if you have not already done so, and log in. Then go to the **Admin console** page, click on **Download databases**, and choose one of the blue buttons to start the download. These are large files, so for a local installation you will need a fast internet connection and plenty of time. For the AWS version of **MiGA** downloads are much faster, and evern **TypeMat\_Lite** should finish in 10 minutes or so. The databases are put in the ```miga-data``` directory.
