# Add a Reference Database \(Optional\)

To classify genomes taxonomically you need to install a referene database. There are two currently available, **TypeMat\_Lite** and **Phyla\_lite**. **TypeMat\_Lite** contains over 13,500 genomes from type material. **Phyla\_Lite** contains one reference genome from each of the 40 bacterial and archaeal phyla. Most of the tuorials use **Phyla\_Lite** so execution times will be shorter.  

**Note:** If you are running MiGA on a cluster, see the section **Installing MiGA using Singularity** for instructions on installing the reference databases. This is because installing larger databases on a cluster should be done by submitting a job.
