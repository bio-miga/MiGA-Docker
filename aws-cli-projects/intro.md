# Introduction

This section includes tutorials for running MiGA projects interactively from the command line locally, on an AWS instance, and on a cluster using Singularity. Long running jobs on AWS should be run in a tmux session (see the section on **Using MiGA AWS**) and long running jobs should be submitted if you are using a cluster (see **Scripts for Cluster Projects**). These tutorials, however, will give you experience in running the various types of MiGA jobs.
