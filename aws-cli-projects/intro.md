# Introduction

This section includes tutorials for running MiGA projects interactively from the command on an AWS instance. Long running jobs on AWS should be run in a tmux session (see the section on **Using MiGA AWS**). These tutorials, however, run within a few minutes and will give you experience in running the various types of MiGA jobs.
