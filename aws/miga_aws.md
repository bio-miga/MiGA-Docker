# MiGA for Amazon Web Services

## Introduction
For those who have large MiGA jobs to run and no access to a compute cluster at their institution, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides an answer. While one could install Docker for Linux in an AWS EC2 instance and then the Docker version of MiGA, we offer a MiGA Amazon Machine Image (AMI) which provides both command line and web-based (MiGA-Web) functionality.
